# Complete each step below according to the challenge directions and 
# include it in this file. Also make sure everything that isn't code
# is commented in the file.  

# I worked on this challenge [by myself].

# 1. Pseudocode

# What is the input?
# What is the output? (i.e. What should the code return?)
# What are the steps needed to solve the problem?


# 2. Initial Solution

# class Array
# 	def pad(min,y=nil)
# 		if array.length < min
# 			return Array.new.pad(x)
# 		else array.length >= min
# 			return array
# 		end
# 	end

# 	def pad!(min,y=nil)

# 	end

# end


# 3. Refactored Solution



# 4. Reflection 

# questions - How do you know a class needs to be created?
# what is self.clone?
# played with this challenge for hours.
