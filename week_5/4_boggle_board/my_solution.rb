# U2.W5: A Nested Array to Model a Boggle Board

# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].

boggle_board = [["b", "r", "a", "e"],
                ["i", "o", "d", "t"],
                ["e", "c", "l", "r"],
                ["t", "a", "k", "e"]]


# Part 1: Access multiple elements of a nested array

# Pseudocode
Part 1: a method that takes a group of coordinates and returns a string of the corresponding 'boggle board' elements
	a. define a method called create_word that takes the parameters board, and *coords
	b. coords has an undefined number of parameters
	c. map those to another array and run coord through each element 
	d. set your bock of code to join your first parameter and last parameter.
Part 2: write a method that takes a row number and returns all the elements in the row.
Part 3: write a method that takes a column number and returns all the elements in the column.
